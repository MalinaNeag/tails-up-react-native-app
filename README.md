# TailsUp

## Project Proposal

**Problem Statement:**
Pet owners often struggle to find trustworthy and convenient pet care services when they travel or work long hours. Traditional methods of finding pet sitters, such as word-of-mouth or small local platforms, are limited in terms of security and the variety of choices.

**Proposed Solution:**
TailsUp is a mobile application that connects pet owners with reliable, verified pet sitters. The app streamlines the process of finding and booking pet care services through features such as pet sitter matching, real-time updates, and comprehensive pet profiles. The platform is secure, user-friendly, and includes geolocation-based search, sitter certification, and integrated payment options.

**Target Audience:**
- Pet owners (especially those who travel often)
- Pet sitters
